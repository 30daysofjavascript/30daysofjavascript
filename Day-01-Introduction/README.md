## 🔹 What is JavaScript?

JavaScript (JS) is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** primarily used for web development. It allows you to:

- Make web pages **interactive**  
- Manipulate the **DOM** (HTML elements)  
- Handle **events** like clicks or form submissions  
- Build **web apps** and **server-side apps** (with Node.js)  

> JavaScript works in almost every modern browser and is a core technology of the web, along with HTML and CSS.
